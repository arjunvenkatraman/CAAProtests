Law makers, law breakers is a citizen led project that aims to objectively document field evidence of democratic protest against the state and the state’s response to it.

Genuine submissions of unedited videos, photos and objective reporting documenting the protests in India and the world against the CAA & NRC are solicited from the public and curated as per the [content policy](https://github.com/kshivanku/CAAProtests/wiki/Content-policy).

## Prologue

On the 11th of December 2019, the [Citizenship (Amendment) act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_(Amendment)_Act,_2019) (CAA) was passed as a law from both houses of the Indian parliament. The act fast tracked the citizenship process to refugees of eligible religions, which was previously not granted to any illegal immigrant. 

The law is to be followed up with the creation of a [National Register of Citizens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Register_of_Citizens) (NRC), where all residents of India would be required to submit proof of their citizenship as legally defined. Doubtful citizens who cannot provide satisfactory evidence could be detained as an illegal immigrant. While any suspected immigrant of the dominant Hindu faith and most minority faiths have a path to Indian citizenship via the CAA, [muslims who account for the second largest faith in the country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_India) (14.2% of population) are excluded from using it to gain citizenship and are at higher risk of being rendered stateless.

The law has since sparked [widespread protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) by the Indian public for being against the [secular spirit of the Indian constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion_in_India#Laws_and_Indian_Constitution) that guaranteed against the state’s discrimination based on religion.

While the Government claims the goal of the CAA is to make India a refuge for religious minorities facing persecution in the neighboring countries, protesters claim the combination of NRC+CAA will give the state undue powers to disenfranchise the population based on religion and will sow the seeds for communal disharmony.

While protests have been largely peaceful, some of them have turned violent and there are conflicting claims between the police and protestors


## Timeline of events
